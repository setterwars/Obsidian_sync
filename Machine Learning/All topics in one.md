# Lecture 1.  Intro to Machine Learning

What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning  computer program that improve their performance at some task through experience.

Data 
$D={(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1}^N$

Performance needs to be defined according to the given task. For example: the ratio of correctly identified malware.
Goal of learning a "Functional" relationship between predictors and target.

### Assessing the quality of learning

${MSE}_{Tr}={Ave}_{i-Tr}[y_i - f(x_i)]^2$

#### What can be wrong in data?

Data is inherently noisy.

# Lecture 2.  Linear regression, LR objective, Method of Least Squares, Closed Form Solution, Polynomial Regression


{#} of defects in $p_i$ = $f({features Of p_i})$
First part is $y_i$, second part is $x_i$
