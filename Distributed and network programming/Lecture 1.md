**A distributed systems is** a failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render own computer unusable.

Multiple computers communicating via network to achieve a task. These computers are called nodes - any communicating device: desktops, servers, cars, sensors.

Distributed Systems are used in: Finance, Education, Transport, Science, Environment, Entertainment etc.

Example of Distributed Systems: Google, Facebook, Skype, BitTorrent, sensor network, Robot Swarms.
#### Why make a  system distributed?
For better scalability, reliability, performance, to solve bigger problems.


Trouble in DS:
- Communications may fail.
- Nodes crash.
- Nondeterministic behaviors.
- Fault tolerance is hard but essential.

Scalability of DS:
- Number of users/clients
- Geographic area
- Power/resource use

Performance of DS 
 - Performance = useful work vs time/resources
 - Focus in Low latency and high throughput

Chaching vs Replication:
Replication = multiple data copies for fault tolerance 
Chaching = tempora
