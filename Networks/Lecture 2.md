# Internet: Organization principles 
#### Home network
- connected devices with in a close vinicity of a home.
- Typically has one WI-FI router
- LAN or Home area network(HAN)
#### Local or Regional Internet Service Provider (ISP)

- Provides an Internet connection to a local communities or small regions 
- Services: IP addresses allocation, domain name registration, web hosting, etc. 
- Owns MAN or WAN networks.
