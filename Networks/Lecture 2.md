# Network characteristics 

| Network Characteristics | Examples                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scale (Geographical)    | LAN (Local area network)<br>MAN (Metropolitan area network)<br>WAN (Wide area network)                                       |
| Transmission Medium     | Optical, Coaxial, Radiowaves, Infrared                                                                                       |
| Protocols/ Technologies | LAN, MAN, WAN, BAN, PAN                                                                                                      |
| Network Topology        | Ring, Star, full mesh, bus, Tree, Hybrid                                                                                     |
| Performance Metircs     | Bandwidth(bits/sec) - max. transfer rate<br>Throughput(bits/sec) actual/average transfer rate<br>Packet loss, Error bit rate |
| Proprietary type        | Open System: OSI-compliant, standart protocols<br>Properietary systems - private technologies and protocols                  |
Most reliable network topology is Full mesh

# Internet: Organization principles 
#### Home network
- connected devices with in a close vinicity of a home.
- Typically has one WI-FI router
- LAN or Home area network(HAN)
#### Local or Regional Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- Examples: Tattelecom is a regional ISP
- Provides an Internet connection to a local communities or small regions 
- Services: IP addresses allocation, domain name registration, web hosting, etc. 
- Owns MAN or WAN networks.
#### Content provider network
- Servers network of a content provider 
- Numerous user requests are handled by different servers.
- Needed for handling simultaneous requests with acceptable quality (delay)
- Can be either local or geographically distributed network
#### Enterprise Network
- Midsize or large enterprise IT infrastructure
- LAN
#### Mobile Network
- A large-scale wireless network
- Radio waves transmission medium
- Multiple radio base stations over large area 
- Mobile Host dynamically reconnect between stations 
#### National or Global Internet Service Providers (ISP)
- Some Russian national ISP: Rostelecom, MTS, Relkom (Demos)
- Provide an Internet connection across a country
- Services:
	-  IP address allocation to a local providers or end users
	- Domain name registration 
	- Web hosting etc.
- Operation with WAN network infrastructure

**The internet - the network of the networks**

#### The internet standards
- Request for Comments (RFC)
- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- The internet corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)

### Analogy: OSI to Physical Letter Delivery 

| OSI Layer    | Paper latter Sending Analogy                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application  | Letter content                                                  |
| Presentation | Letter content language, destination address language           |
| Session      | Post office visit, letter type choice , signatures and payments |
| Transport    | Overall letter delivery process (e.g. Avoidance of letter loss) |
| Network      | Letter delivery route                                           |
| Data link    | Letter transportation between adjucent points                   |
| Physical     | Physical letter paper                                           |

### Network protocols
- DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol : IP addresses assignment
- DNS: Damain name system : URL resolution protocol
- HTTP: HyperTest Transfer protocol : Web page access
- FTP: File transfer: Files Download/uplaod
- SMTP: Simple Mail Transport : Email sending
- POP: Post Office 
- IMAP: Internet Message Access
- MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
